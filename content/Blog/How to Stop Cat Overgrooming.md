[Overgrooming in cats](https://londonexpertfinder.com/services/pet-grooming/), also known as psychogenic alopecia, is a condition where a cat excessively licks, bites, or scratches parts of their own body, often leading to hair loss and skin damage. It’s estimated that around 10-15% of cats exhibit overgrooming behavior at some point in their lives. While the exact causes are unknown, overgrooming is thought to be triggered by stress, anxiety, boredom, allergies or other skin irritations. Treatment involves identifying and addressing any underlying medical or behavioral causes, providing environmental enrichment and using medication or supplements if necessary.

## Some common signs of overgrooming in cats include:

- Excessive licking, biting or scratching of the same area, leading to bald patches or thinning fur. Common overgroomed areas include the belly, legs, paws and base of the tail.
- Red, inflamed or broken skin from excessive grooming. Cats may cause sores, scabs or abrasions from biting, scratching or over-licking.
- Hair loss in blotchy patterns. The bald patches are often symmetrical on both sides of the body.
- Excessive grooming right after being petted or handled by humans. The overgrooming behavior may be triggered by stress.
- Agitation, restlessness or signs of distress right before or during grooming sessions.
- Noticeable thinning of the fur over time from damage caused by overgrooming. The coat may look ragged or uneven.

If you notice any of these signs in your cat, overgrooming may be the cause. It’s important to identify and address the underlying issue before the behavior becomes compulsive. Here are some steps you can take:

## Rule Out Medical Causes

First, take your cat to the vet to rule out any medical conditions causing skin irritation, pain or discomfort that may be triggering the excessive grooming. Skin allergies, parasites like fleas or mites, infections or other dermatological issues can cause itchiness, inflammation and discomfort that leads to overgrooming. Your vet can perform tests and prescribe medications to treat any medical causes found.

## Common medical causes include:

- Allergies - Both food and environmental allergies can cause itchy skin, leading to overgrooming. A change in diet or medications may be needed.
- Parasites - Fleas, mites and other parasites can bite and irritate the skin. Treatments will kill and prevent parasites.
- Infections - Bacterial or fungal skin infections like ringworm cause irritation and discomfort. Antibiotics or antifungals will be prescribed.
- Pain - Arthritis, nerve damage or other conditions causing pain can prompt grooming. Pain relievers may help.
- Endocrine disorders - Hormonal imbalances like hyperthyroidism may trigger obsessive grooming. Hormone therapy or medications can treat the imbalance.

If no medical cause is found, the overgrooming is likely psychogenic or stress-related. But first addressing any medical issues can greatly improve excessive grooming behavior.

## Reduce Stress and Anxiety

For psychogenic overgrooming, focus on identifying, managing and reducing any sources of stress, anxiety or conflict in your cat’s environment. Cats are sensitive creatures of habit that can be stressed by changes in routine, new people or pets, loud noises, unfamiliar surroundings and more. Monitor your cat closely to pinpoint triggers. Ways to reduce stress include:

- Maintain consistent daily schedules for feeding, play, grooming and litter box cleaning. Cats thrive on predictability and routine.
- Give your cat “safe spaces” to retreat from kids, dogs or noise, like cat towers or cozy boxes. Provide outdoor-indoor access if possible.
- Use calming pheromone diffusers and sprays designed for cats. These can reduce anxiety and create a sense of familiarity.
- Try calming treats, supplements or anti-anxiety medications prescribed by your vet. These can take the edge off while you address the root of their stress.
- Gradually introduce changes like new furniture, visitors or pets. Familiarize cats with new things so they’re less frightening.
- Play relaxing music and keep TVs or radios off when no one is home to prevent startling noises.
- Give your cat more positive attention like treats, play and affection at times they seem stressed. Extra bonding helps them feel secure.

Providing a calm, soothing home environment can prevent anxiety build up and reduce triggers. But identifying and eliminating specific stressors is key to stopping the overgrooming response.

## Give Environmental Enrichment

Bored, inactive cats are prone to overgrooming to self-soothe. Make sure your cat has plenty of opportunities for play, exercise and environmental stimulation. Enrichment relieves boredom and anxiety. Try these ideas:

- Have several play sessions per day with interactive wand toys. Chase toys provide exercise and mental stimulation.
- Set up cat activity centers with tunnels, scratching posts, climbing platforms and toys. Rotate in new toys to keep them interested.
- Place bird feeders and water fountains near windows for “cat TV”. Watching nature is very enriching.
- Provide puzzle feeders that make cats work for their food using paws and brain. Feed meals this way.
- Plant some cat grass or catnip for them to nibble on. Cat-safe plants are great sensory enrichment.
- Set up perches near windows for sunbathing, people watching and fresh air. Outdoor access is ideal.
- Consider getting a second cat for companionship and play if yours is solitary. Properly introduced cats can enrich each other’s worlds.

A mentally stimulated, active cat is less prone to compulsive overgrooming behaviors. Providing abundant enrichment outlets can make a big difference.

## Use Distractions

When you catch your cat excessively grooming the same spot, distract them from the behavior with something enticing. This interrupts the obsessive pattern. Useful distractions include:

- Tossing a ball, crinkle toy or catnip mouse in another direction to divert their attention and initiate play.
- Breaking out an interactive wand toy and having an energetic play session.
- Calling them over for a high reward treat like a Greenie or piece of tuna.
- Picking them up and moving them to a window perch or cat tree in another room.
- Turning on a bird video or music designed for cat relaxation.
- Giving them a food puzzle, box or paper bag to explore.
- Brushing or petting them in a favored spot until they settle down. Physical touch soothes cats.
- Placing them in your lap and holding gently until calm.

The goal is to interrupt the obsessive grooming habit and redirect their mind and body. Over time, try using distractions before they even start grooming to break the pattern.

## Use Anti-Anxiety Medications

For severe psychogenic overgrooming, medications may be needed on a short or long-term basis to calm anxiety while you determine the triggers. Your veterinarian is the only one who can prescribe appropriate anti-anxiety meds for your cat. They are usually given orally. Some options include:

- Benzodiazepines like alprazolam (Xanax). These anti-anxiety drugs work quickly to relieve stress but can have side effects. Strict dosage guidelines must be followed.
- Tricyclic antidepressants like Clomicalm. These boost serotonin to improve mood over time and reduce obsessive behaviors. They take several weeks to work.
- Supplements like Zylkene or Anxitane provide calming amino acids to take the edge off anxiety. Fewer side effects than medications.

Medication can provide fast-acting relief in combination with behavior modification techniques. Work closely with your vet on proper dosage and weaning once underlying stressors are identified and managed.

## Use Elizabethan Collars and Bandages

In extreme overgrooming cases, an E-collar or bandages may be needed to prevent a cat from chewing hot spots raw or creating open wounds while the underlying problem is addressed. These should only be used under a vet’s guidance to avoid harm. Possible options include:

- Inflatable Elizabethan collars - These prevent licking and chewing problem areas on the body while allowing the cat to eat, drink and function. They are less obstructive than traditional cones.
- Partial limb bandages - Breathable stretch bandages can be gently wrapped around wrists or lower legs to protect a specific overgroomed area temporarily during treatment.
- Bite-not collars - These fabric collars have plastic guards over the shoulders to block biting the back without a cone. They allow more mobility.
- Recovery shirts/suits - Shirts made of breathable fabric can cover the cat's torso to prevent chewing their belly or back while still allowing bathroom use.

Physical barriers should never be left on for extended periods to avoid injury or distress. Use the least restrictive option only as needed under supervision. The root causes still must be addressed for real improvement.

## Be Patient and Consistent

Keep in mind that resolving overgrooming takes time and dedication. There is no quick fix. Medical issues, stress and compulsions develop over a period of time. Likewise, it requires consistency managing medical treatment, reducing stressors, providing enrichment and interrupting patterns to see long-term improvement. Commit to frequent intervention and environmental adjustments. With time, patience and perseverance, overgrooming can be overcome. But always work closely with your veterinarian for medical causes and guidance. If no improvement is seen over several months, further diagnostic tests may be needed or a veterinary behaviorist should be consulted to develop a tailored treatment plan. With the right approach, your cat can break the overgrooming cycle and their coat and skin can heal.

In summary, cat overgrooming has both medical and behavioral components. It's important to rule out medical causes first, then identify and reduce sources of stress and anxiety in the environment. Providing a predictable routine, environmental enrichment to prevent boredom, and distractions when overgrooming occurs can all help break the obsessive habit. Medications may provide temporary relief while the root problems are addressed through behavior modification and training. With consistent effort to improve their quality of life and meet their needs, cats can overcome overgrooming behavior and tendencies. The key is addressing the underlying issues triggering the excessive grooming, rather than just treating the behavior on the surface level. A multi-pronged approach tailored to your individual cat can get to the bottom of the problem and lead to lasting improvement in their obsessive grooming habits.
