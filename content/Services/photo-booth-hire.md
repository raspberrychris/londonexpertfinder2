I recently hired a photo booth for my wedding reception and it was a huge hit! Everyone had so much fun taking pictures and the quality of the photos was amazing. The booth was easy to set up and the attendant was very helpful and friendly. The props were great and the guests had a blast. I would highly recommend photo booth hire for any special event. It was an affordable and fun way to capture memories that will last a lifetime. I'm so glad I decided to go with this service and would definitely use it again.
