I recently started learning signwriting and I'm so glad I did! Signwriting is an amazing way to communicate with the deaf and hard of hearing community. It's a visual language that uses symbols to represent the handshapes, facial expressions, and body movements used in sign language. It's a great way to bridge the gap between hearing and non-hearing people.

I was a bit intimidated at first, but the SignWriting website made it really easy to get started. They have a great selection of tutorials and resources that make it easy to learn the basics. I was able to pick up the basics in no time and now I'm able to communicate with deaf and hard of hearing people with ease.

SignWriting is an invaluable skill that can open up a world of communication. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn a new language and connect with the deaf and hard of hearing community. It's a great way to learn a new language and make a difference in the world.
