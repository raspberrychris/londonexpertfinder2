title: Airbnb Cleaning Service London (How to find the best cleaners)
---

Airbnb has become an incredibly popular way for people to find accommodations when travelling. With over 6 million Airbnb listings worldwide, travellers can find everything from a couch to crash on to entire houses and apartments to rent out. Airbnb allows homeowners to rent out their properties on a short-term basis, creating an alternative to hotels and traditional bed and breakfasts. 

One major consideration for Airbnb hosts is keeping their properties clean for guests. While some hosts choose to handle all the cleaning themselves, many opt to hire professional cleaning services to help maintain their Airbnbs between guest stays. This is especially common for hosts renting out multiple Airbnb properties. 

In a city like London with over 80,000 Airbnb listings, there is huge demand for Airbnb cleaning services. London hosts want to ensure their properties shine to garner positive reviews and maintain their Airbnb occupancy rates. This article will explore the Airbnb cleaning market in London - the benefits of hiring cleaners, what to look for in a service, average costs, and recommendations for the best cleaning companies to consider.

## Benefits of Hiring Airbnb Cleaners in London

There are many advantages to hiring professional Airbnb cleaning services as a host in London:

- Time Savings - Cleaning an entire home takes significant time and effort. Pro cleaners can thoroughly clean in a fraction of the time it would take for a host to do it themselves. This allows hosts to focus on other aspects of managing their Airbnbs.

- Deep Cleaning - Professional cleaners have industrial-strength supplies and tools that enable them to deep clean at a level hosts likely can't replicate on their own. Things like carpet shampooing and oven cleaning are best left to the pros. 

- Expansive Service Offerings - Companies offer a wide array of services in addition to cleaning like laundry, linen service, restocking supplies, waste disposal, etc. This comprehensive service is invaluable for Airbnb hosts.

- Guest Experience - Cleanliness is a top priority for Airbnb guests. Professional cleaning translates to better reviews and happier repeat customers.

- Property Maintenance - Regular deep cleans by professionals help maintain the condition of the property over time.

- Consistency - Contracting with a service ensures the property is cleaned thoroughly and consistently every time.

- Coordination and Flexibility - Cleaners manage the cleaning schedule, coordinating with guests and accommodating any last minute changes.

When vetting cleaning companies, Airbnb hosts should look for those that specialize in Airbnb and short-term rental cleaning. This ensures they understand the unique needs of preparing a property in-between guests.

## What to Look For in an Airbnb Cleaning Service
