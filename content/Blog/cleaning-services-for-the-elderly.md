title: Cleaning for the elderly
---

> As people get older, staying on top of household chores can become more challenging. Regular cleaning is important for maintaining a safe and healthy home environment, but tasks like vacuuming, mopping, and scrubbing bathrooms may be difficult or even impossible for seniors with limited mobility or health issues. This is where cleaning services tailored for the elderly can provide a helpful solution.

Hiring professional cleaners to come into the home on a regular basis offers many benefits for seniors. A thorough cleaning can remove dirt, dust, allergens, and germs that can exacerbate health problems like asthma and respiratory illness. Cleaning services also make sure high-touch surfaces like door handles, light switches, remotes, and tables are sanitized to prevent the spread of viruses and infections. For the elderly who have trouble seeing clutter or reaching to clean in hard-to-access areas, a comprehensive cleaning is important for reducing falls and other accidents in the home. 

Beyond the health perks, professional cleaners lift the burden of physically demanding chores the elderly may not be able to tackle alone anymore. The consistency of a regular cleaning schedule also establishes order and routine for seniors who need help maintaining tidiness and organization. And most importantly, sparkling clean carpets, shiny floors, and a naturally freshened home can boost mood and mental health.

## What to Look for in a Cleaning Service

When hiring cleaners for an elderly loved one, finding a trustworthy and reliable service is key. Look for established companies that have a reputation for thorough and consistent cleaning, along with policies that thoroughly screen, train, and supervise staff. The ideal cleaning crew will be punctual, professional, and bonded and insured for protection. 

It's also important to find a service that specializes in cleaning for seniors and has experience accommodating aging-related needs. This includes staff who are patient, compassionate, and willing to take extra time never to rush clients. Cleaners should follow senior-friendly practices like announcing themselves before entering, being mindful of noise levels, and avoiding moving or removing personal items. Cleaning sessions can be tailored based on which tasks are most needed or most challenging for an individual.

For elderly clients who need assistance with tidying and organization beyond basic cleaning, look for services that offer decluttering, laundry help, meal prep cleanup, and other related services. Some companies also provide safety and wellness checks during cleanings to give family members peace of mind. 

When meeting with a cleaning company, be sure to communicate any health issues, physical limitations, accessibility needs, or cleaning schedule preferences. Establishing an open line of communication up front ensures the cleaners understand how to properly support a senior's cleaning needs.

## Cleaning Services to Request

Typical professional cleanings for the elderly focus on general tidying and deep cleaning of key rooms and surfaces. Here are some recommended services to request:

- Vacuuming and mopping floors
- Dusting furniture, ceiling fans, shelves, windowsills 
- Cleaning bathroom sinks, showers, toilets, mirrors
- Wiping down kitchen counters, appliances
- Changing bed sheets 
- Sanitizing doorknobs, light switches, remote controls
- Removing trash and recycling

Cleaners can tackle additional tasks like inside oven cleaning, window washing, and baseboard scrubbing on an as-needed basis. Decluttering and organizing spaces like closets, pantries, and garages may also be helpful. Just be sure to inform the cleaners which areas need attention ahead of time.

For seniors who need extra care around the house, cleaning crews can also assist with laundry, changing bed linens, wiping down kitchen surfaces after meals, unloading dishwashers, taking out trash, and other daily maintenance tasks. This helps limit the physical demands on elderly residents between deeper cleaning sessions.

Depending on client needs and abilities, some cleaning companies allow seniors to be present and provide direction during cleaning sessions. For those who need more hands-on assistance, cleaners can lend a hand with tasks like sorting belongings, folding laundry, sweeping floors, wiping counters, and more while cleaning. This gives seniors mobility and cognitive activity along with a cleaner home.

## Cleaning Schedule and Costs

Most cleaning companies offer regular recurring service on a weekly, biweekly, or monthly basis. Weekly or biweekly cleanings are ideal for seniors who need more frequent tidying and disinfecting. Monthly deep cleanings work for those who just need a thorough refresher of the home on occasion. 

Following a consistent schedule helps maintain cleanliness over time rather than allowing mess and grime to build up between intermittent sessions. Routine cleanings also reinforce structure and active living for the elderly. Adjustments can always be made to the frequency over time if needs change.

Professional cleaners typically charge hourly fees, ranging from $25 to $50 per hour on average. This covers labor costs for the specified cleaning tasks. The total cost per session depends on the size of the home, amount of cleaning required, and number of cleaners assigned. Discounts may be available for seniors on fixed incomes.

Upfront contracts for recurring service often offer lower rates and locked-in pricing. Make sure payment terms and cancellations are clear. Look for companies that allow service pausing or schedule changes in case of hospital stays or other disruptions. Additional fees may apply for deep cleanings or decluttering projects beyond the routine cleaning scope.

## Getting Started

Arranging professional cleaners for an elderly parent or loved one has many health and lifestyle benefits. When selecting a cleaning company, look for bonded, insured services with senior-specific experience and policies. Meet for an initial consultation to align on a cleaning routine, scope, and schedule that fits the senior's needs and budget. 

With regular tidyings and deep cleanings, seniors can enjoy a fresher, safer living environment without the struggle of physically demanding chores. A pristine home also boosts mental health and uplifts spirits for more positive aging. Professional cleaners lift the cleaning burden while providing caring companionship and oversight for older individuals.

## Conclusion

Hiring cleaning help can greatly improve quality of life for seniors who have difficulty maintaining household tidiness and cleanliness on their own. With professional cleaners handling physically strenuous chores, elderly clients benefit from a hygienic home without the stress and health risks of letting messes and grime build up over time. 

Trustworthy cleaning services also give family members and caregivers peace of mind knowing their aging loved ones have assistance with daily living maintenance. Establishing a regular cleaning routine aids seniors struggling with organization or forgetfulness as well. And most importantly, professional cleanings allow the elderly to feel comfortable and confident living independently in their own well-kept homes.
