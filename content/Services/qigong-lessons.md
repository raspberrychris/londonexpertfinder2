I recently started taking qigong lessons and I absolutely love it! It has been a great way to relax and de-stress after a long day. The instructor is very knowledgeable and patient, and he has helped me learn the basics of qigong in a short amount of time. I feel like I'm getting stronger and more flexible with each lesson.

The qigong lessons have also helped me to focus on my breathing and to be more mindful of my body. I'm learning to be more aware of how my body feels and how to move it in a way that is beneficial. I'm also learning how to use my breath to help me relax and stay present.

I would highly recommend qigong lessons to anyone looking to relax and de-stress. It is a wonderful way to connect with your body and to learn how to move it in a mindful and beneficial way. If you're looking for a way to relax and reduce stress, qigong lessons are definitely worth checking out!
