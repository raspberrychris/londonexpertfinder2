- Quick turnaround needs - Accountants charge premium rates for rushed or last-minute filings, especially if you bring documents in late.
- Tax planning & strategy - Fees increase if you need additional tax planning and strategy sessions, multi-year projections, advice on major transactions, etc.
- Audit support - Accountants charge significantly higher rates if you get audited and need their expertise and efforts to handle an IRS or state tax audit.

When setting their rates, accountants consider factors like overhead, employee salaries, licensing fees, technology costs and the complexity of returns they handle. Many charge hourly rates ranging from $50-$500 per hour based on experience level.

- Review billing - Check for errors in billing and request removal of unnecessary charges.
- Use a lower-cost accountant - Shop around online, but confirm they are registered and reputable.
- Adjust next yearâ€™s withholding - Increase your tax withholding to get as close to zero due/refund as possible and simplify next year's return.
