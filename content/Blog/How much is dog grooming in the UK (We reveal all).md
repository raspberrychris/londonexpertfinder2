[Dog grooming](https://londonexpertfinder.com/services/pet-grooming) is an essential part of being a responsible pet owner. Regular grooming keeps your dog's coat and skin healthy, prevents matting, and allows you to monitor their overall health and wellbeing. But how much should you expect to pay for professional dog grooming services in the UK?

The cost of dog grooming can vary quite a bit based on several factors like your location, the size and breed of your dog, the specific services you require, whether you use a salon or mobile groomer, and how often you get your dog groomed. In this comprehensive guide, we'll break down the average prices for dog grooming across the UK and the key considerations that impact the cost.

## Average Dog Grooming Prices in the UK

On average, dog owners can expect to pay the following for professional dog grooming in the UK:

- Basic bath and brush: £25 to £40
- Full grooming service (bath, dry, brush, trim nails, neaten coat): £30 to £60 for small dogs, £40 to £80 for large dogs
- Luxury or full show trims: £60 to £100+

So for most typical family pets, a standard full grooming service will cost £40 to £60 at an average salon or groomer. For large dogs or more complex coats and styling, it could be upwards of £70 or £80. Luxury grooms with hand-stripping, dyed fur, styled cuts, and added treatments will run over £100.

You can also find mobile dog grooming services that come to your home. These tend to cost about £5 to £10 more on average than going into a salon.

## Factors That Influence Dog Grooming Prices

Where you live in the UK can significantly impact how much you'll pay. Dog grooming costs tend to be highest in major cities like London and lowest in rural areas. Regional averages run:

- London: £50 to £70 for a full groom
- South East England: £40 to £60
- South West England: £38 to £50
- Midlands: £35 to £50
- North of England: £30 to £45
- Scotland: £35 to £50
- Wales: £35 to £45
- Northern Ireland: £30 to £50

The breed and size of your dog is another major cost factor for grooming. Larger dogs and breeds with thick coats like retrievers, collies, huskies, and shepherds require more time, labour, equipment, and product to properly bathe, dry, and groom. Special handling may also be required for breeds like pugs and Persian cats with flat faces. Expect to pay:

- Small dogs: £30 to £50
- Medium dogs: £40 to £60
- Large/extra large dogs: £50 to £80+

Regular grooming every 4 to 8 weeks will cost less per visit than infrequent grooming which requires more work to remove mats and overgrowth. Some salons offer loyalty discounts of 5% to 10% for repeat customers.

Full show trims, styled cuts, special treatments, and add-ons like nail polishing, teeth cleaning, flea treatments, and de-shedding will all increase your total grooming bill. Simple bath and brush services start around £25 to £40.

## Choosing a Dog Groomer: Salons vs Mobile Groomers

Dog grooming businesses in the UK typically operate as either:

- Dog grooming salons or parlours: Brick-and-mortar establishments where you drop off your dog. May have multiple staff groomers.
- Mobile dog grooming: A groomer with a custom van outfitted with tubs, dryers, and tools who comes to your home. May be a solo business.

Dog salons can cost £5 to £20 more on average than mobile grooming, but offer convenience for multi-dog households. Visiting a salon also gets dogs comfortable being handled by new people. Mobile grooming allows a shy or anxious dog to stay in a familiar environment during the process.

When researching local groomers, look for these signs of a quality professional:

- Certified by the British Dog Grooming Association or Pet Industry Federation. This requires extensive training and continuing education.
- Years of experience and client reviews. Look for groomers with 5+ years experience and strong word-of-mouth.
- Calm, friendly handling and attention to safety. Your dog should never seem scared or uncomfortable.
- Clean, organised facility or van. Avoid dirty, cluttered spaces.
- Offers to discuss your needs and inspect your dog's coat before grooming. This consultation is key.
- Explains every step of the process and answers all your questions. transparent pricing.

## Prices Can Vary by Postcode

Where you live can mean a £10 to £20 difference in the cost of a basic dog groom. Prices tend to be highest in London and other areas in the South East like Surrey, Brighton, and Kent. For example, in affluent Chelsea or Kensington you may pay £70 for a basic groom compared to £40 in a small Yorkshire village.

The biggest factor influencing this regional variation is the local cost of rent and business expenses like insurance. Overheads are highest in London and popular tourist areas. Rural areas with lower property prices offer savings that many groomers pass onto customers.

Population density also impacts pricing. Areas with more demand allow businesses to charge slightly higher rates. Competition is lower when there are fewer groomers working in remote countryspots.

If affordability is a concern, some options include:

- Asking mobile groomers if they offer discounts for travelling to you in rural areas
- Checking salons in nearby small towns which may have lower pricing
- Avoiding luxury big city groomers used by celebrities and the wealthy
- Seeing if any shops offer loyalty cards or deals for repeat customers
- Asking new or independent businesses about discounts to attract customers
- Getting quotes from several groomers before deciding where to book

With some research and flexibility, dog owners can find professional grooming services at affordable prices. Don't hesitate to ask businesses about their rates and any ways to save on costs.

## Large Dogs Require More Time and Expertise From Groomers

Grooming costs also rise based on your dog's size and specific breed. Larger dogs mean the groomer needs more time, energy, and equipment to properly bathe, dry, trim, and style your pet's coat.

Trying to scrub down, rinse, and dry a Saint Bernard is far more physically demanding and time consuming than grooming a miniature pinscher. Large dogs may need to be groomed on special hydraulic tables that can be raised and lowered rather than standard stationary ones. Drying very thick coats requires more powerful pet dryers.

Certain breeds also have specialized hair, skin, and styling needs. For example:

- Huskies and other double-coated dogs require careful blow drying and brushing to avoid matting and shedding.
- Cocker spaniels are prone to ear infections if not properly cleaned and dried after baths.
- Short-nosed breeds like pugs and French bulldogs require extra attention to facial folds to prevent irritation. Slow, gentle handling is important.
- Hand stripping some terrier coats properly takes skill and patience.

The training and experience needed to properly groom large complicated coats and breeds is why prices are typically higher. Ensure any new groomer is qualified to handle your dog's specific needs before booking.

## Cost Saving Tips For Dog Owners

While good grooming is critical for your dog's health, there are ways to save on costs if you're on a tight budget:

- Ask about loyalty discounts for repeat customers. Salon membership plans or bundles can also reduce per-visit rates.
- Inquire about off-peak pricing. Early morning, weekday, and winter appointments often have lower demand so some businesses discount them.
- Learn to do basic bathing and brushing at home between full grooms. Reduces how often they're needed.
- Buy your own brush, shampoo, and nail clippers for home upkeep. Quality tools pay for themselves over time.
- Compare rates of salons vs. mobile or independent groomers in your area.
- Book for two dogs together. Some groomers may offer pricing deals.
- Consider an apprentice groomer under supervision of veteran staff. Can save 20%.
- Avoid add-ons like styled cuts, dyes, perfumes to limit costs. Stick to necessities.
- Ask friends with dogs for recommendations of affordable local groomers.

While grooming itself isn't expensive, costs add up for pups who need frequent trips. Factor grooming expenses into your budget before getting a dog. Be open and upfront with groomers if needing to work within certain price ranges.

## How Often Dogs Need Professional Grooming

Most dogs need full grooming every 4 to 8 weeks year round. Grooming frequency depends on factors like:

- Coat type - Dogs with continuously growing hair like poodles require the most regular trimming and shaping. Double-coated breeds can go a bit longer between full grooming sessions. Short-haired dogs need less.
- Shedding - Heavy shedding dogs benefit from regular bathing, brushing, and removing dead hair to control loose fur and prevent matting.
- Skin sensitivity - Dogs with allergies or other skin issues may need medicated baths and skin soothers more often.
- Coat condition - Knotting, clumping and overgrowth happens quickly on neglected coats. This takes more work to fix.
- Overall health - Ill, injured, or elderly dogs may need truncated grooming appointments to avoid stress and fatigue.
- Living environment - Dogs who spend time outdoors or swimming may need cleaning more often than indoor pups. City dogs also pick up more dirt than rural.
- Affordability - If budgets are tight, extend the time between full grooms. Brush thoroughly between visits.

Puppies being acclimated to grooming may only need a few brief sessions at first. Show dogs require weekly intensive grooming to stay picture perfect. Pet insurance can reimburse grooming costs due to covered health conditions.

Ask your groomer their recommendation for a schedule based on your dog's specific needs. Be consistent with appointments to keep their coat, skin, ears, nails, and teeth in optimal shape.

## Puppy Grooming Has Added Benefits

While grooming puppies requires gentle handling, starting at a young age has benefits:

- Helps them learn to tolerate being handled, touched, and restrained. Important for vet visits and injury treatment.
- Lets them become comfortable with the sights, sounds, and sensations of grooming like running water, clippers, nails being trimmed, and brushed fur.
- Allows for regular inspections for potential problems like skin irritation, fleas, and ear mites which are common in puppies. Early detection prevents worsening.
- Provides opportunity for early training and socializing with new people. This supports good behavior later in life.
- Removes puppy fur which is often softer and lintier than adult coats. Prevents matting as adult fur grows in.

Puppy grooming sessions are shorter, about 15 to 20 minutes at 4 to 6 month intervals to start. Positive rewards during and after will build a lifetime of good grooming experiences.

Finding a groomer experienced with puppies is key. Be wary of any squirmy, restless, or frightened behavior and talk to your vet if concerns arise. A little patience goes a long way in raising a confident, well-adjusted dog.

## How Matted Fur Impacts Dog Grooming Cost

One factor that can significantly increase the cost of grooming an unkempt dog is severe matting of their fur. Removing extensive clumps of tangled hair takes considerable time and care.

Matted fur pulls uncomfortably on a dog's skin when they move. Trapped debris and moisture under mats can also lead to sores or infections. Removing mats is important for health and comfort.

Lightly matted fur can be gently brushed out. Heavier mats may require cutting through them with scissors. Severe matting often necessitates shaving the dog's coat short to remove it.

De-matting is a delicate process requiring patience and care not to nick or injure the dog's skin. Therefore, groomers typically charge an additional fee based on the extent of mats such as:

- Light matting: £5 to £10 extra
- Moderate matting: £15 to £25 extra
- Heavy matting: £30+ extra on top of normal grooming price

Preventing mats in the first place is ideal for your dog's comfort and your wallet. Regular brushing, combing, and grooming appointments are key. In between visits, watch for small tangles developing and gently work them out.

If you've waited too long between professional grooming sessions, be prepared to pay a higher price. Schedule more frequent grooming for heavy shedding breeds like huskies to avoid excessive matting woes.

## The Importance of Tipping Your Dog Groomer

It's customary to tip your professional dog groomer, typically an extra 10% to 20% in addition to the quoted service price. Tipping recognizes the physicality and skill of their work. Like hairstylists, tipping is how most groomers make their living.

Beyond monetary compensation, here are some other ways to show appreciation for your groomer if they provide an exceptional service:

- Write a positive review online and tell friends. Word-of-mouth referrals are invaluable.
- Send new clients their way or offer testimonials. Helps grow their business.
- Give thank you cards or bring home baked treats like cookies for the groomer and staff. A little gift of appreciation goes a long way.
- Be patient and understanding if they're running a bit behind during the busy holiday season. They likely have a packed schedule and are doing their best.
- Let them know if your dog seemed perfectly content and calm after a visit. Feedback is helpful.
- Wish them a sincere "Happy Holidays," "Thank You," etc. during major seasons. It's a tough, physical job that can often go under appreciated.
- Respect their time by showing up promptly for appointments and giving advance notice if you need to reschedule.
- Understand if they refuse services like severely matted coats that would cause dog discomfort and require excessive time to fix. This avoids frustration for both parties.

Showing your groomer a little extra gratitude will help build a great relationship with the person caring for your beloved pet.

## In Conclusion

Dog grooming is a regular expense for owners, but knowing average costs and how various factors like location, breed, and coat condition impact pricing can help you budget accordingly.

Full grooms at UK salons and professional mobile groomers typically range from £30 to £60 for small dogs and £40 to £80 for large dogs on average. Cross-comparing rates in your area while asking about any discounts can help you find affordable options for your pup.

Setting up a consistent grooming schedule based on your dog's specific needs keeps their coat healthy and prevents matting issues that add to expenses down the road. Building a good relationship with a groomer you trust while tipping them for quality service ensures your dog receives the pampering they deserve.
